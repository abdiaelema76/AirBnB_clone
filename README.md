#AirBnB CLONE PROJECT

The AirBnB project is our attempt to create a clone that mimicks AirBnB.
AirBnB is a service that connects property owners and travelers, by providing a platform where property owner can rent out their property spaces to people(travelers) looking for a place to stay

#COMMAND INTERPRETTER
The command interpretter is a shell-like interface that is a link between the user(developer) and the back-end of the platform.
It is responsible for translating commands entered by the user(developer) into actions taken by the operating system. It also displays the results of these actions to the user.
It also provides a CLI(Command Line Interface) that allows the user to interact with the backend side of the platform
